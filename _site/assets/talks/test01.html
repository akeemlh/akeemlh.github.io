    <p>
    I am a second year PhD student studying at Queen Mary University of London under Dr Abbey Waldron. I am working on investigating the properties of neutrinos as part of the MINERνA and DUNE collaborations. If you don’t know what any of the physics jargon on this page means, take a look at the talks and presentations I’ve given, there’s a good chance I’ve discussed some of it before, or feel free to drop me an email, I love talking about exciting physics.

    <h1>MINERνA</h1>
    <p>
    * Data Preservation: I have worked on the data preservation effort at MINERνA; working to ensure the medium to long term usability and utility of MINERνA data for the wider particle physics community. I extended existing data preservation software to enable new analyses with MINERνA data
    </p>

    * Analysis: I am working on an analysis of muon neutrino inclusive scattering across the different nuclear targets in MINERvA. The objective is to contribute to advancing our understanding of how various nuclear environments influence neutrino interactions and our ability to observe them. Knowing more about how neutrinos behave has a beneficial effect all across the field of neutrino physics and even beyond.

    <h1>DUNE</h1>
    <p>
    * 2x2: I am working on the 2x2 near-detector demonstrator at DUNE. The 2x2 LArTPC modules have recently been constructed at the University of Bern and shipped to Fermilab, where they will sit in the NuMI beamline, taking the first neutrino beam LArTPC data at DUNE. I work on the installation and testing of these modules, as well as DAQ software integration and development.
